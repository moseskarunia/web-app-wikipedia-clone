			<p>The franchise originated as a pair of role-playing games developed by Game Freak, from an original concept by its founder, Satoshi Tajiri. Released on the Game Boy on February 27, 1996, the games became sleeper hits and were followed by manga series, a trading card game, and anime series and films. From 1998 to 2000, Pokémon was exported to the rest of the world, creating an unprecedented global phenomenon dubbed "Pokémania". By 2002, the craze had ended, after which Pokémon became a fixture in popular culture, with new products being released to this day. In the summer of 2016, the franchise spawned a second craze with the release of Pokémon Go, an augmented reality game developed by Niantic. Pokémon has since been estimated to be the world's highest-grossing media franchise and one of the best-selling video game franchises.</p>

			<p class="red-paragraph">Pokémon has an uncommon ownership structure.<sup>[11]</sup> Unlike most IPs, which are owned by one company, Pokémon is jointly owned by three: Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures.<sup>[1]</sup> Game Freak develops the core series role-playing games, which are published by Nintendo exclusively for their consoles, while Creatures manages the trading card game and related merchandise, occasionally developing spin-off titles. The three companies established The Pokémon Company (TPC) in 1998 to manage the Pokémon property within Asia. The Pokémon anime series and films are co-owned by Shogakukan. Since 2009, The Pokémon Company International (TPCi), a subsidiary of TPC, has managed the franchise in all regions outside of Asia.<sup>[12][13]</sup></p>

			<h2 id="name">Name</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>The original full name of the franchise is <b><i>Pocket Monsters</i></b> (<b>ポケ</b>ット<b>モン</b>スター, <b>Poke</b>tto <b>Mon</b>sutā), which has been commonly abbreviated to Pokemon (ポケモン) since its launch. When the franchise was released internationally, the short form of the title was used, with an acute accent (´) over the e to aid in pronunciation for English speakers.<sup>[14]</sup><p>

			<p>Pokémon refers to both the franchise itself and the creatures within its fictional universe. As a noun, it is identical in both the singular and plural, as is every individual species name;<sup>[15]</sup> it is grammatically correct to say "one Pokémon" and "many Pokémon", as well as "one Pikachu" and "many Pikachu".<sup>[16]</sup></p>

			<p>The Pokémon franchise is set in a world in which humans coexist with creatures known as Pokémon. Pokémon Red and Blue contain 151 Pokémon species, with new ones being added in subsequent games; as of January 2024, 1,025 Pokémon species have been introduced.<sup>[c]</sup> Most Pokémon are inspired by real-world animals or mythical creatures based on real-life folklore.<sup>[17]</sup> For example, Pikachu are a yellow mouse-like species<sup>[18]</sup> with lightning bolt-shaped tails<sup>[19]</sup> that possess electrical abilities.<sup>[20]</sup></p>

			<p class="red-paragraph">The player character takes the role of a Pokémon Trainer. The Trainer has three primary goals: travel and explore the Pokémon world; discover and catch each Pokémon species in order to complete their Pokédex; and train a team of up to six Pokémon at a time and have them engage in battles. Most Pokémon can be caught with spherical devices known as Poké Balls. Once the opposing Pokémon is sufficiently weakened, the Trainer throws the Poké Ball against the Pokémon, which is then transformed into a form of energy and transported into the device. Once the catch is successful, the Pokémon is tamed and is under the Trainer's command from then on. If the Poké Ball is thrown again, the Pokémon re-materializes into its original state. The Trainer's Pokémon can engage in battles against opposing Pokémon, including those in the wild or owned by other Trainers. Because the franchise is aimed at children, these battles are never presented as overtly violent and contain no blood or gore.<sup>[II]</sup> Pokémon never die in battle – they faint upon being defeated, and can then be rejuvenated at a Poké Center.<sup>[III]</sup></p>

			<p>When a Pokémon wins a battle, it gains experience points.<sup>[29]</sup> After gaining a certain amount of it, the Pokémon levels up, and its statistics rise. As its level increases, the Pokémon learns new offensive and defensive moves to use in battle.<sup>[30]</sup><sup>[31]</sup> Furthermore, many species can undergo a form of spontaneous metamorphosis called Pokémon evolution, and transform into stronger forms.<sup>[32]</sup> Most Pokémon will evolve at a certain level, while others evolve through different means, such as exposure to a certain item.<sup>[33]</sup></p>
